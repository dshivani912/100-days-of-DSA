# 100-days-of-DSA
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge focused on Data Structures and Algorithms!

## Goal
The primary goal of this challenge is to enhance my understanding of various data structures and algorithms, and to improve problem-solving skills in programming.

## Progress
I'll be documenting my daily progress in this README. Each day, I'll summarize what I've learned, the problems I've solved, and any additional resources I've found helpful.

## Daily Logs
##### Day-1 
* Reverse an array problem solved and explored different algorithms.</br>
* Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.
##### Day-2
* Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array </br>
* Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo.
##### Day-3
* Move all the negative elements to one side of the array.
* Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays.
##### Day-4
* Write a program to cyclically rotate an array by one.
##### Day-5
* Find Largest sum contiguous Subarray
* Minimise the maximum difference between heights
