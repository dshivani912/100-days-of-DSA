# 100-days-of-DSA
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge focused on Data Structures and Algorithms!

## Goal
The primary goal of this challenge is to enhance my understanding of various data structures and algorithms, and to improve problem-solving skills in programming.

## Progress
I'll be documenting my daily progress in this README. Each day, I'll summarize what I've learned, the problems I've solved, and any additional resources I've found helpful.

## Daily Logs
#### Day-1
Reverse an array problem solved and explored different algorithms.
